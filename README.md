Conventional [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/b34y026n60v9oe16?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/andrewabest/conventional)
============

Conventional provides a suite of ready-made tests for enforcing conventions within your types, assemblies, solutions and databases to make sure your duckies are all in a row.

Conventional's backlog can be found here https://trello.com/b/kay7a8Ya/conventional

## To install from NuGet

    Install-Package Best.Conventional

## Type Conventions

### Sample Usage

Standard Syntax
```c#
new[] { typeof(MyType), typeof(MyOtherType) }
    .MustConformTo(
        Convention.PropertiesMustHavePublicGetters.And(
        Convention.PropertiesMustHavePublicSetters))
    .WithFailureAssertion(Assert.Fail);
```

Fluent Syntax
```c#
new[] { typeof(MyType), typeof(MyOtherType) }
    .MustConformTo(Convention.PropertiesMustHavePublicGetters)
    .AndMustConformTo(Convention.PropertiesMustHavePublicSetters)
    .WithFailureAssertion(Assert.Fail);
```

Or Mix It Up!
```c#
new[] { typeof(MyType), typeof(MyOtherType) }
    .MustConformTo(
        Convention.PropertiesMustHavePublicGetters.And(
        Convention.PropertiesMustHavePublicSetters))
    .AndMustConformTo(Convention.MustHaveADefaultConstructor)
    .WithFailureAssertion(Assert.Fail);
```

### Supplied Type Conventions

- Properties must have public getters
- Properties must have public setters
- Properties must have protected setters
- Properties must have private setters
- Name must start with
- Name must end with
- Must live in namespace
- Must have a default constructor
- Must have a default non-public constructor
- Must have appropriate constructors
- Must have attribute
- Must not take a dependency on
- Must not have a property of type
- Requires a corresponding implementation of (T)
- Enumerable properties must be eager loaded
- Collection properties must be immutable
- All properties must be immutable
- Must not use DateTime.Now
- Must not use DateTimeOffset.Now
- Exceptions thrown must be derived from specified type
- Must instantiate properties of specified type in default constructor
- All properties must be instantiated during construction

### Supplied Type Conventions (.Net 4.5 Only)

- Void methods must not be async
- Async methods must have 'Async' suffix
- Libraries should call Task.ConfigureAwait(false) to prevent deadlocks

## Solution Conventions

### Sample Usage

```c#
ThisSolution
    .MustConformTo(Convention.MustOnlyContainToDoAndNoteComments)
    .WithFailureAssertion(Assert.Fail);
```

### Supplied Solution Conventions

- Must only contain Todo and Note comments
- Must only contain informative comments
- Files must be embedded resources

## Database Conventions

### Sample Usage

```c#
TheDatabase
    .WithConnectionString("YourConnectionString")
    .MustConformTo(Convention.AllIdentityColumnsMustBeNamedTableNameId)
    .WithFailureAssertion(Assert.Fail);
```

### Supplied Database Conventions

- All identity columns must be named tablenameId
- All tables must have a clustered index

## Assembly Conventions

### Sample Usage

Strongly typed
```c#
typeof(MyType)
	.Assembly
	.MustConformTo(Convention.MustNotReferenceDllsFromBinOrObjDirectories)
    .WithFailureAssertion(Assert.Fail);
```

Pattern matched
```c#
TheAssembly
	.WithNameMatching("MySolution.MyProject")
	.MustConformTo(Convention.MustNotReferenceDllsFromBinOrObjDirectories)
    .WithFailureAssertion(Assert.Fail);
```

### Supplied Assembly Conventions

- Must not reference dlls from bin or obj directories

### Dealing with a funky folder structure?

Conventional assumes that your solution root will be three folders (..\..\..\) from where the tests are running. If it is not set your solution root in your global test setup
```c#
KnownPaths.SolutionRoot = @"c:\projects\MySolutionRoot"
```
